To modify the sale.order.line view so that the sequence field is shown twice, once as a widget and once as a regular number field, you would need to modify the form view of the sale.order model where the sale.order.line is defined as a One2many field (usually with a tree view inside a form view).

Here is an example of how you can extend the view in an XML file within your custom module:

xml
Copy code
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<odoo>
    <data>
        <!-- Inherit the view where you want to make changes -->
        <record id="view_order_form_inherit_sequence" model="ir.ui.view">
            <field name="name">sale.order.form.inherit.sequence</field>
            <field name="model">sale.order</field>
            <field name="inherit_id" ref="sale.view_order_form"/>
            <field name="arch" type="xml">
                <!-- Locate the tree view of the sale order line you want to modify -->
                <xpath expr="//field[@name='order_line']/tree" position="inside">
                    <!-- Add the sequence field as a widget handle -->
                    <field name="sequence" widget="handle"/>
                    <!-- Add the sequence field again as a number -->
                    <field name="sequence" string="Sequence Number"/>
                </xpath>
            </field>
        </record>
    </data>
</odoo>
